This project analyzes student enrollment trends in Canada using data from Statscan - Table: 37-10-0011-01 (formerly CANSIM 477-0029).

The project addresses key questions, including but not limited to:

Which provinces are experiencing the fastest growth?
1. Is the contribution of international students increasing?
2. Which types of programs (Bachelor's, Master's, PhD) are gaining more interest?
3. Which fields of study are the most popular?

Key Findings:
1. In 2023, international students made up less than 25% of total enrollments but contributed approximately 40% of education revenue.
2. Some fields of study have seen shifts in popularity over time. For example, humanities have declined in popularity since 2000, while IT and engineering have grown. Meanwhile, business-related degrees remain the most popular.
3. Women enroll in higher numbers than men across various programs.
